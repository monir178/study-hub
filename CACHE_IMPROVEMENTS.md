# Cache Handling Improvements

## Problem

When navigating between different tabs/routes (e.g., User Management → Analytics → Settings → User Management), the app was showing loading skeletons even when returning immediately to a previously visited page. This indicated that cache wasn't being handled properly.

## Root Causes

1. **Short stale times**: Data was being considered stale too quickly (2-5 minutes)
2. **Short cache times**: Data was being removed from cache too early (10 minutes)
3. **Component unmounting**: Route changes cause components to unmount/remount, potentially causing unnecessary refetches
4. **Missing placeholder data**: No previous data shown while fetching new data

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Increased Global Cache Settings

- **Stale time**: 5 minutes → 10 minutes
- **Garbage collection time**: 10 minutes → 30 minutes
- **Added placeholder data**: Keep previous data while loading new data
- **Disabled refetch on window focus**: Prevents unnecessary refetches when switching tabs

### 2. Feature-Specific Cache Optimizations

#### Users Hooks

- `useUsers()`: Stale time increased to 15 minutes, GC time to 30 minutes
- `useUser(id)`: Stale time increased to 20 minutes, GC time to 45 minutes
- Added placeholder data to prevent loading states

#### Admin Hooks

- `useAdminDashboardStats()`: Reduced refetch interval from 30s to 60s for better performance
- Increased stale time to 30 seconds
- Added placeholder data

#### Rooms Hooks

- `useRooms()`: Stale time increased to 10 minutes, GC time to 20 minutes
- Added placeholder data

### 3. Navbar Authentication Improvements

- Updated to use authentication state instead of variant prop
- Shows user avatar and dropdown when authenticated
- Proper responsive design for mobile
- Role-based menu items (admin panel for admins)

## Technical Benefits

1. **Reduced loading states**: Users see cached data immediately when returning to pages
2. **Better UX**: Smooth navigation without unnecessary loading spinners
3. **Reduced API calls**: Less server load and faster response times
4. **Intelligent caching**: Different cache times based on data volatility
5. **Placeholder data**: Shows previous data while fetching updates

## Cache Strategy by Data Type

- **User data**: Long cache (15-20 min) - users don't change frequently
- **Dashboard stats**: Medium cache (30s-1min) - needs regular updates but not too frequent
- **Room data**: Medium cache (10 min) - moderate update frequency
- **Real-time data**: Short cache with active refetch intervals

## Testing

To test the improvements:

1. Navigate to User Management page (loads data)
2. Switch to Analytics tab
3. Switch to Settings tab
4. Return to User Management
5. You should see cached data immediately, no loading skeleton

The cache will only refetch if:

- Data is older than the stale time
- Component is mounted for the first time
- Manual refresh is triggered
- Network reconnection occurs
