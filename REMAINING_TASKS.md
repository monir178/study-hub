# Remaining Tasks and Implementation Notes

## âœ… Completed

1. **Cache Handling Improvements**
   - Increased stale times and garbage collection times
   - Added placeholder data to prevent loading states
   - Optimized query configuration per feature
   - Documented all improvements in CACHE_IMPROVEMENTS.md

2. **Navbar Authentication**
   - Shows proper authenticated/unauthenticated states
   - User avatar with fallback logic
   - Dropdown menu with role-based items
   - Responsive mobile design
   - Proper navigation items based on auth state

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

### 1. Test Cache Improvements

- Start the development server
- Navigate between User Management â†’ Analytics â†’ Settings â†’ User Management
- Verify that no loading skeleton appears when returning immediately
- Test with different user roles and authentication states

### 2. Extend Architecture to Other Features

The current architecture is ready to be extended to other features:

#### Authentication Feature

- Move auth components to `features/auth/`
- Create `features/auth/hooks/useAuth.ts`
- Create `features/auth/services/auth.service.ts`
- Create `features/auth/types/index.ts`

#### Notes Feature

- Create `features/notes/hooks/useNotes.ts`
- Create `features/notes/services/note.service.ts`
- Create `features/notes/types/index.ts`
- Create `features/notes/components/`

#### Timer/Sessions Feature

- Create `features/timer/hooks/useTimer.ts`
- Create `features/timer/services/timer.service.ts`
- Create `features/timer/types/index.ts`
- Create `features/timer/components/`

#### Chat/Messages Feature

- Create `features/chat/hooks/useChat.ts`
- Create `features/chat/services/chat.service.ts`
- Create `features/chat/types/index.ts`
- Create `features/chat/components/`

### 3. Additional Optimizations

#### Cache Persistence

- Consider implementing cache persistence with localStorage
- Add cache warming strategies for critical data

#### Real-time Updates

- Implement WebSocket connections for real-time data
- Add optimistic updates for better UX

#### Error Boundaries

- Add error boundaries for each feature
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed queries

### 4. Testing

- Add unit tests for hooks
- Add integration tests for components
- Test cache behavior across different scenarios

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus

The cache handling issue should now be resolved. The main improvements:

1. **Longer cache times**: Data stays fresh longer
2. **Placeholder data**: Shows previous data while loading
3. **Optimized refetch behavior**: Less unnecessary network requests
4. **Feature-specific optimization**: Different cache strategies per data type

Test the User Management page navigation to verify the improvements are working as expected.
